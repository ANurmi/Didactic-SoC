# Kactus2 + IPXACT

These are brief instructions for using kactus2.

## IPXACT standard

IPXACT is standard for IPs, their interface, connectivity and memory map. They do not contain any behavioral data.

## Standard version

This repository IPXACT is latest standard (1685-2022, in short, referred as 22 standard). This requires Kactus2 to be sufficiently new version. It is highly recommended to stay on the lasted release with the 22 standard.

You can also see the [kactus2dev](https://github.com/kactus2/kactus2dev/) repository for lasts updates.
